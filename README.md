# CheapsharkGameDeals

Welcome to the Cheapshark Game Deals gem! This project was developed for a project for Flatiron School coding bootcamp. It allows a user to access updated game deals from the Cheapshark API all through a CLI.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cheapshark_game_deals'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cheapshark_game_deals

## Usage

Run the './bin/cheapshark-game-deals' file and your off the the races! The app prompts the user through the rest of the process.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
